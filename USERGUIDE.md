## Introduction
The Target365 SDK gives you direct access to our online services like sending and receiving SMS, address lookup and Strex payment transactions.
The SDK provides an appropriate abstraction level for Node development and is officially support by Target365.
The SDK also implements very high security (ECDsaP256 HMAC).

## Setup
### Target365Client
```Node
const uuidv4 = require('uuid/v4');
const moment = require('moment');
const Client = require('target365-sdk');

let baseUrl = "https://shared.target365.io";
let keyName = "YOUR_KEY";
let privateKey = "BASE64_EC_PRIVATE_KEY";
let serviceClient = new Client(privateKey, { baseUrl, keyName });
```
## Text messages

### Send an SMS
This example sends an SMS to 98079008 (+47 for Norway) from "Target365" with the text "Hello world from SMS!".
```Node
let outMessage = {
    transactionId: uuidv4(),
    sender: 'Target365',
    recipient: '+4798079008',
    content: 'Hello World from SMS!'
};

await serviceClient.postOutMessage(outMessage);
```

### Schedule an SMS for later sending
This example sets up a scheduled SMS. Scheduled messages can be updated or deleted before the time of sending.
```Node
let outMessage = {
    transactionId: uuidv4(),
    sender: 'Target365',
    recipient: '+4798079008',
    content: 'Hello World from SMS!',
    sendTime: moment().add(1, 'hours').format()
};

await serviceClient.postOutMessage(outMessage);
```

### Edit a scheduled SMS
This example updates a previously created scheduled SMS.
```Node
let outMessage = serviceClient.getOutMessage(transactionId);
outMessage.SendTime = moment().add(1, 'hours').format();
outMessage.Content += " An hour later! :)";

serviceClient.putOutMessageAsync(outMessage);
```

### Delete a scheduled SMS
This example deletes a previously created scheduled SMS.
```Node
serviceClient.deleteOutMessage(transactionId);
```

## Payment transactions

### Create a Strex payment transaction
This example creates a 1 NOK Strex payment transaction that the end user will confirm by replying "OK" to an SMS from Strex.
```Node
let transaction = {
    transactionId: uuidv4(),
    merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
    shortNumber: '2002',
    recipient: '+4798079008',
    price: 1,
    serviceCode: '10001',
    invoiceText: 'Donation test'
};

serviceClient.postStrexTransaction(transaction);
```

### Create a Strex payment transaction with one-time password
This example creates a Strex one-time password sent to the end user and get completes the payment by using the one-time password.
```Node
let transactionId = uuidv4();

let oneTimePassword = {
    transactionId: transactionId,
    merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
    recipient: '+4798079008',
    recurring: false
};

await serviceClient.postOneTimePasswordAsync(oneTimePassword);

// *** Get input from end user (eg. via web site) ***

let transaction = {
    transactionId: transactionId,
    merchantId: 'YOUR_MERCHANT_ID',
    shortNumber: '2002',
    recipient: '+4798079008',
    price: 1,
    serviceCode: '10001',
    invoiceText: 'Donation test',
    oneTimePassword: 'ONE_TIME_PASSWORD_FROM_USER',
};

serviceClient.postStrexTransaction(transaction);
```

### Reverse a Strex payment transaction
This example reverses a previously billed Strex payment transaction. The original transaction will not change,
but a reversal transaction will be created that counters the previous transaction by a negative Price.
The reversal is an asynchronous operation that usually takes a few seconds to finish.
```Node
let reversalTransactionId = serviceClient.reverseStrexTransaction(transactionId);
```
## Lookup

### Address lookup for mobile number
This example looks up address information for the mobile number 98079008. Lookup information includes registered name and address.
```Node
let lookup = serviceClient.addressLookup("+4798079008");
let firstName = lookup.firstName;
let lastName = lookup.lastName;
```

## Keywords

### Create a keyword
This example creates a new keyword on short number 2002 that forwards incoming SMS messages to 2002
that starts with "HELLO" to the URL "https://your-site.net/api/receive-sms".
```Node
let keyword = {
    shortNumberId: 'NO-2002',
    keywordText: 'HELLO',
    mode: 'Text',
    forwardUrl: 'https://your-site.net/api/receive-sms',
    enabled: true
};

let keywordId = serviceClient.postKeywordAsync(keyword);
```

### Delete a keyword
This example deletes a keyword.
```Node
serviceClient.deleteKeywordAsync(keywordId);
```

### SMS forward
This example shows how SMS messages are forwarded to the keywords ForwardUrl. All sms forwards expects a response with status code 200 (OK). If the request times out or response status code differs the forward will be retried several times.
#### Request
```
POST https://your-site.net/api/receive-sms HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: your-site.net

{
  "transactionId":"00568c6b-7baf-4869-b083-d22afc163059",

  "sender":"+4798079008",
  "recipient":"2002",
  "content":"HELLO"
}
```

#### Response
```
